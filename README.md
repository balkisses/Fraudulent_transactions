# Fraudulent_transactions
**Project Overview**

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent transactions using machine learning techniques. We utilize a dataset from Kaggle and apply the XGBoost algorithm for classification, achieving an accuracy of 0.88. Additionally, we build an interactive dashboard using Gradio to make predictions based on user inputs.

**Technologies Used**

Python: Main programming language

XGBoost: Machine learning model for classification

Gradio: Dashboard for user-friendly interaction

Pandas & NumPy: Data manipulation and preprocessing

Scikit-learn: Data processing and evaluation metrics

**Dataset**

The dataset is sourced from Kaggle and contains transaction details. The goal is to predict whether a transaction is fraudulent or not based on selected features.

**Feature Selection**

To choose the best features, we analyzed similar fraud detection projects and identified commonly used features that contribute significantly to classification performance.

**Model Training**

The dataset was preprocessed, including handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.

We trained an XGBoost classifier, which demonstrated strong performance with an accuracy of 0.88.

**Interactive Dashboard**

To make the model accessible, we developed a Gradio-based dashboard where users can input transaction details and get instant fraud predictions.
